# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security patches will mainly target the latest release version,
as listed on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/babel/) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/python-babel/babel/releases).

Patches for particularly high-impact security issues be backported to older versions as need be,
but Babel has generally been extremely backward compatible (within major version series),
so for many users, simply upgrading to the latest release should be rather frictionless.

If you're using a version of Babel packaged by a downstream distribution,
such as Debian, Ubuntu, etc., they may backport patches from newer versions with a different policy.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please feel free to report vulnerabilities by any method below you feel comfortable with:

* You can use GitHub's form [over here](https://github.com/python-babel/babel/security/advisories/new).
* Contact a maintainer, presently [@akx](https://github.com/akx), over email (akx@iki.fi) or direct messages on listed socials.
  * If you need an encrypted channel of communications, please email/DM first and we'll set something up.
